Conducting a Phishing Workshop with a partner. During the workshop, we delved into the world of phishing, exploring its various techniques. we discussed email-based phishing, spear phishing, and even more sophisticated methods like voice phishing and smishing. Through real-time demonstrations and simulations, the participants gained firsthand experience of how these attacks are orchestrated. This hands-on approach fostered a deeper understanding and enhanced their ability to identify and combat phishing attempts.
